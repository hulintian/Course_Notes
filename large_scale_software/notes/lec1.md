# Large-Scale Software Reuse and Software Product Line Engineering

- not only a small pieces

- product software not only for src
- the money pay for the arch is more than for src
    - more reuse in arch

- software product line
    - massive software develop

## About Paradigm

- how to develop sw
    - the concept

- need continue learn
    - new ideas , new ideas ... new !!!

- Datafication
    - make the program to produce data to generate system, process data

## Architecturization

- component by component

- no-code platform
- low-code platform 
    - stm32 cubemx

## Intensification


--- 

- let arch develop sw directly
- high level structure

--- 

# chapter 1
# Software Reuse in the very large -- Software in Datafication

- reuse is necessary

## The drive of reuse

- same design use many times

## Software era

- era(时代)

- data mining
    - get the information from data

## Two kind of Resources

- sw resources = static resources + active resources
